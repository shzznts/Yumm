Yumm is a Basic Android Recipe Generator App
-Uses Punchfork API to retrieve random recipes
-Uses Android SQLite to store favorites

Built to itch a needed recipe tool. Feel free to take it on as your own. 
Could use some optimizations and a better design.
Good to use as a basis for json web requests and Android SQLite programming.

Instructions:
1. Change the API_URL in RecipeHandler to your registered Punchfork API key.
2. Modify the DEFAULT_RECIPES_TO_LOAD in RecipeHandler to your desired number.
